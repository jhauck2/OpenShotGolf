## How to Contribute to Open Shot Golf

### Just Getting Started?
The [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) are an invaluable resource for all contributors regardless of their experience level. 
If you are just getting started with Godot, please take a look at the [Getting Started](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html) section of the Godot Docs.  
  
Also, please look at the [Godot Best Practices](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/index.html) before contributing.

### Issues and PRs

#### Should I Write an Issue?
For any changes other than small bug fixes or slight tweaks, it is preferred to first write up an issue describing the reason for the change and the planned approach for implementation.  
*Note: This is not a hard and fast rule, please use your best judgement.*  
  
This gives maintainers and others in the community the chance to give input and suggestions on if the change is necessary/desired or if the implementation approach needs to be changed.  
  
Finally, writing an issue before submitting a pull request gives more context to reviewers and establishes an agreed upon implementation plan which will make reviews more clean and efficient.

#### Issue and PR Scope
Please keep issue and PR scope limited to a single feature or bug. This will help keep reviews small and focused and ensures PRs get merged in a timely fashion.

#### Comment Resolution
Just a small nit-pick/preference. When working on a PR, please let the comment author resolve their comments. If changes have been made to address a particular comment, add a sub-comment to let the author know that the changes are ready to be reviewed. This helps reviewers keep track of which issues have and have not been resolved.

### Use of AI
This section defines rules for contributions where an AI system is the primary author of the code (i.e., most of the pull request was generated by AI).  
For minor AI-assisted edits, suggestions, or completions where the human contributor is clearly the primary author, these rules do not apply.  

#### Disclosure
Contributors must disclose AI involvement in the pull request description whenever these guidelines apply.

#### Review, Oversight, and Test
Contributors must:  
- Review and understand all AI generated code before committing.
- Fully test the code to ensure that it meets the intent of the Issue/PR without injecting any unintended side-effects
- Ensure all changes/additions follow Godot best practices which can be found [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/index.html)  
- Ensure all code is properly commented to help reviewers and future contributors understand the purpose and function of the code.

#### Why These Rules Exist
AI tools have made it possible and even trivial to implement entire features with only a few prompts. While this implementation can appear to be correct, it is often overly verbose, lacks comments, is poorly architected, does not follow best practices, and takes much more effort to review and correct than it does to implement.  
  
It is NOT the intent of these rules to discourage new contributors or to ban AI usage outright.  
  
Contributors are highly encouraged to use github issues or discussions to get answers to any questions they may have on how to best implement a feature or bug fix.
